# analytics-event-tracking
## Custom analytics tracking for news.embl.de
This code tracks the user's clicks in various parts of the EBI site and logs them as GA events.

Links in non-generic regions can be tracked by adding the class `track-with-analytics-events` to a parent div. Careful with the scoping.
